title: Concert Visuals pt 2
text: >-
  The fine folks in Lilac Cruise, a local band, asked my to create Visuals for
  their upcoming concerts. Because they are not going to be playing very many
  shows in 2020, they wanted the shows they do play to be a little more engaging
  and special. This is just a sample of the hour-long animation I made for them.
