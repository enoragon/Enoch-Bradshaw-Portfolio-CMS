title: Hackathon Heroes
text: >-
  One weekend, two days, a few energy drinks, 121 work hours, and loads of fun.
  What does all of this describe? The experience my team and I shared at
  Springfield's [Hack For Good](https://hack4goodsgf.com/) Competition. If you
  don't already know, Hack For Good is a coding competition where the community
  comes together and competes to create the best product for a non-profit in the
  community. During this competition, my team and I broke down the requirements
  into small sections and mapped out a schedule. We would help each other out
  when someone was falling behind. We were dedicated, determined, but most
  importantly we joked around and pushed each other through the sleep
  deprivation. With all that, we were able to pull together and [win the gold
  medal.](https://www.matasgf.com/news/2019/pr-hack-4-good-hosts-fourth-annual-weekend-event-springfield-missouri/?fbclid=IwAR3x6321_9XDjy_SAejPIJoT85Qdt5S4S_hUM9KUJbqvIaMDOwT_M9IlM0U)
