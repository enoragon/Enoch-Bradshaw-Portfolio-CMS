title: Noodle Dimension
text: "Sometimes I just need to go to my happy place. With this Noodle Dimension, and the power of Virtual Reality, \rI was able to will this dream land into reality. This project is my piece of a inter-dimensional showroom. Basically, each developer at Self Interactive made a VR Room and there was a lobby to get to each room. We showcased this passion project at a pop-up art-show. You should have been there. It was dope."
