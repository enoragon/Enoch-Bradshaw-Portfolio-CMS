title: ' Developed and Released Mobile Apps'
text: >-
  In a professional setting I have developed apps with React Native. During that
  time, I also gained experience releasing apps to both the App Store and the
  Google Play Store. Let me tell ya, releasing mobile apps can be a humbling
  experience. There can be some back and forth and things can go wrong, but all
  in all it's a great learning experience.
